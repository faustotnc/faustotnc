My name is Fausto German. I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte with a B.S. in Computer Science. Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science degree in Computer Science at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech), specializing in data science, machine learning, and interactive sensemaking. My primary interests revolve around multimodal deep learning and explainable A.I. (XAI).
